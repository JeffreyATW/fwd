## Front-end Web Development
# Assignment for Week 17

1.  Create an HTML file and a CSS file.
2.  Add a `<title>` to the `<head>`.
3.  Link the CSS file to the HTML file by creating a `<link>` element in the `<head>`.
4.  Add a `<meta>` tag that, on mobile devices, causes the viewport to match the device's width.
5.  Add a `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, and `<footer>` to the `<body>`.
6.  Put some random text inside each element so you can distinguish them from one another.
7.  Create a media query section in the CSS file that targets screens that are 960px wide or more.
8.  Add a rule to the media query section to make the `<body>` 960px wide.
9.  Add a rule to the media query section to make the `<nav>` and `<aside>` 200px wide.
10.  Add a rule to the media query section to make the `<article>` 500px wide.
11.  Add a rule to the media query section to make the `<nav>`, `<article>` and `<aside>` float to the left.
12.  Add a rule to the media query section to make the `<footer>` clear the floated elements.

### Extra credit:

*   Style the elements inside the `<body>` so they are more visually distinct. Make sure these rules apply regardless of screen resolution.
*   Space the elements out from one another by 20px when the window width is above AND below 960px.
