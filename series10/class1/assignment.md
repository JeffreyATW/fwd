## Front-end Web Development

# Assignment for Week 1

Create a file called `index.html` and a file called `style.css`.

In `index.html`, add a `doctype` and an `<html>` element.

Inside that `<html>` element, add a `<head>` element and a `<body>` element.

Inside the `<head>` element, add a `<title>` element and put the title of the page inside it.

Inside the `<body>` element, add a `<h1>` element and put the main heading of the page inside it.

Inside the `<body>` element, after the `<h1>` element, add a `<p>` element and put a few sentences inside it.

Inside the `<p>` element, surround some words in an `<a>` element.

Add an `href` attribute to the `<a>` opening tag, and make its value your favorite website. Don't forget the `http://`.

Include the CSS file in the `<head>` of the HTML file by using a `<link>` element. Add a `href` attribute and set its value to the filename of your CSS file. Add a `rel` attribute and set its value to `stylesheet`.

Create a CSS rule:

*   Set the selector to one of the elements inside the `<body>`
*   Add a declaration:
    *   Set the property to `color`
    *   Set the value to your favorite color

Make sure to save both files!

### Extra credit:

We didn't exactly cover the these in class. You'll have to Google up how to do them:

*   Add a second rule to the CSS file.
*   Create and link a second stylesheet to the HTML file.
*   Use a `script` tag to point to a JavaScript file containing the following:

    `alert('You did it!');`

*   Create a second HTML file and link to it from the first one.
*   Give one of the types of elements a different background color.
*   Specify the human language of the document.
