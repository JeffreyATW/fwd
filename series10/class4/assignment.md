## Front-end Web Development

# Assignment for Week 4

1.  Create an HTML file (a blank file with a `.html` extension).
2.  Create a JS file (a blank file with a `.js` extension).
3.  Add a `<script>` tag to the HTML file. Set its `src` attribute to the name of your JS file.
4.  In the JS file, declare a variable called `x`.
5.  Assign the number 1000 as the value of `x`.
6.  Declare a variable called `y` and assign the number 234 as its value.
7.  Declare a variable called `sum` and assign it the sum of `x` and `y` (JavaScript should do this math, not you).
8.  Declare a variable called `message` and assign it a string that says, in sentence form, what the sum is (concatenation is necessary).
9.  Use the `alert` DOM function to show the `message` to the user.

*   Redo the above without declaring any variables.
