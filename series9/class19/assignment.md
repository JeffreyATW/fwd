## Front-end Web Development
# Assignment for Week 19

Your job is to modify the CSS that goes along with [this site](assignment). You **cannot** change the HTML - you can only modify `style.css`. It should end up looking like this:

![Mockup](assignment.png)

## Notes:

*   The background of box one is an image, not a semi-transparent color.
*   The "contents" of boxes two, three, and four are not text; they're using the image files that come with the assignment.
*   You will need to apply the [image replacement hack](http://www.zeldman.com/2012/03/01/replacing-the-9999px-hack-new-image-replacement/) to boxes two, three, and four.
*   The text in the final box has been pre-positioned using a combination of `text-indent` and `line-height`, two properties I don't expect you to know.
