## Front-end Web Development
# Assignment for Week 6

1.  Check out this repository (or run `git pull`) and make a copy of the [`series9/class6/assignment` folder](https://github.com/JeffreyATW/fwd/tree/master/series9/class6/assignment).
2.  Include a `<script>` reference in the HTML file to the latest version of jQuery.
3.  Create a JS file of your own and include a `<script>` reference to it in the HTML file.
4.  Add behavior that makes clicking the "Add a new item" `button` create a new item at the end of the `to-do-list`, based off the first existing item. You will want to use these jQuery functions:
    *   `$`
    *   `.on` (with the `'click'` event)
    *   `.first`
    *   `.clone`
    *   `.append`
    
    Read up on the [jQuery API Documentation](http://api.jquery.com/) to learn how to use these functions. A great help would be to use this version of the [Twitter client](https://github.com/JeffreyATW/fwd/tree/master/series9/class6/noisetwitter) we looked at in class, which uses the above functions.

## Extra credit:

1.  Change the CSS so `new-field` is shown by default.
2.  Change the JS such that the text in the new item is the same as what's in `new-field`. You will need these additional jQuery functions:
    *   `.text`
    *   `.val`

* * *
